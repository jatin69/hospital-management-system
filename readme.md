# Hospital Management System

A simple hospital management system with GUI using Java JFrames and MySQL database.

## Dev

- `Trivia` -  This code was made way back in 2015
- `Requirement` - Java JDBC Driver (`com.mysql.jdbc.Driver`) is required to connect to database
- There's one external dependency `jcalendar-1.4.jar` which is provided in this repo
- MySQL is used as a database
- Database credentials are set in `src/myDB/DBconnect.java`
- `Issue` - Database dump is not available for now, however, it can be easily remade by reverse engineering the queries used in the project
- Recommended editor is `Netbeans` for this project
    + It provides GUI design with drag and drop
    + Easily resolves dependencies
    + Makes development a breeze
- Screenshots couldn't be made available at this moment.
